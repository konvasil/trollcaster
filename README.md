# ðŸ§Œ Trollcaster ðŸ“¡

**Trollcaster** is a real-time chat monitoring and visualization tool that detects toxic or troll-like messages using a machine learning model trained on custom keyword data. Built with Flask, Socket.IO, and integrated with p5.js for dynamic visual feedback, the project not only identifies and filters trolling behavior but also triggers both audio (via OSC) and visual alerts in response. Designed for interactive installations or performance environments, TrollCaster serves as an artistic and technical exploration of AI moderation, live data sonification, and immersive user experience.
